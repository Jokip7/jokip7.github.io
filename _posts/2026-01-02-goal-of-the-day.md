I want to try something new this year, a Goal of the Day (GOTD).
I've been bullet journaling for a few years now. But my daily log gets pretty... blergh sometimes. Gunked up with relatively unimportant stuff.
I tend to prioritize this unimportant stuff over the things that are _actually_ important but I don't feel like doing.
To counteract this, I am going to try a Goal of the Day. A goal that says: If only this gets achieved, today will still be a success.
