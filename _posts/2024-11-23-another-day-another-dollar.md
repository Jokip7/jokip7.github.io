It has been over ten months since I wrote for this blog.

After my first post I had the admittedly ambitious goal to write a post every week.
Well... weeks turned into months, months turned into seasons and so on. But here we are. Here I am!

Months later, and my blog is still squatting on its little corner of the internet.
Which begs the question, where have I been? Why haven't I written anything if I enjoy writing as much as I claimed in my first post?
Have I been off on far voyages across distant seas? Have I been scaling mountains? Fording rivers? Have I been finding a cure for cancer?
Simply too busy to attend to anything other than some vitally important mission?
Yes! Wait, no. None of those things. I've been here. Where I've always been. I played video games. I read. I worked. I traveled. I did things I thought were valuable.
But my blog has been gathering dust. Writing a post kept crawling its way unto my to-do list. Every time I put it off. Something about it's visibility made it feel impossible.
I have struggled with this type of procrastination all my life.

I think my procrastination on this blog stems from a feeling of inadequacy. Sometimes I feel so far behind, I look at other's successful blogs. It's not even about great stonking numbers. About getting another 70 gazillion views.
I just wonder what not getting the same engagement says about me. It feels like being behind. It makes me want to catch up.
Rise from irrelevance. As evidence of my worth.

But that's neither here nor there. For now, I am content with writing something short. Another meta piece! **\[Crowd jeering in the background\]**

I have some ideas for future posts I want to enumerate.

I've been giving Python courses for a couple of months now. That has been very fun but also incredibly anxiety-inducing.
It's a subject I want to touch upon -- those anxiety inducing things. It often lies at the core of my procrastination.
When I push through it feel great! But sometimes I manage (like today!), and other times I don't. Why is that?

Some other ideas floating around my mind are:

- Antipatterns of Azure Data Factory -- Bad design decisions forced upon you by ADF
- Work -- what it means to work, what makes work fun and what makes work suck.
- Journaling and bullet journaling
- Taking initiative
- Stress management
- Being in nature

I also want to write reviews of books, movies and games. If only to think through what I think about a piece of media and why.

I addition, I would like to put myself through a few challenges and document my experience.

Anyways. That is all for now. I just wanted to get something out to break the ice.

More posts coming soonâ„¢!
