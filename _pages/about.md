I'm a 26 year old software developer working as a data engineer.
I love history, reading, biology, nature, travel, and -- well -- many things.
It's hard to summarize one's personality in a paragraph or so.

Chris Ist is a place for me to share my writing and ideas publicly, in an interesting manner -- if all goes well.
